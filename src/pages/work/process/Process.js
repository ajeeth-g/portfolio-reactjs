              Understanding the problem has always been the forefront of my
              process. I consider project briefing as the most important stage
              as erroneous understanding can lead to misguided designs.

              <strong className="padded-right-16">Strategy</strong> Clients come
              in different takes; some say they know what they want, and some
              might have no idea. Whatever their take may be, I always ask for
              their objective, and dive deep to understand what can solve their
              problem.

                Design → Review → Iteration
              </strong>{" "}
              Most of the times, I dive straight to doing wireframes in Figma or
              Sketch. From wireframes to high-fidelity designs, I take client
              engagement in high regard. Reviews and feedback make part in the
              success of the project. Necessary iterations can take place until
              we achieve the desired solution.
